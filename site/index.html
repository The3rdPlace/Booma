    <title>Booma - a SDR VLF receiver</title>
</head>
<body>

This is Booma - a SDR VLF receiver born out of curiosity while listening to the <a href="https://alexander.n.se">SAQ / Grimeton transmitter</a> using a
WebSDR receiver somewhere in Germany.
<br><br>

Currently, all Booma can do, is to listen to frequencies in the audio range (using a soundcard as the receiver frontend),
and detecting CW and RTTY signals. However, I have big plans for extending the basic receiver for use with RTL based
sdr dongles and, at least, listning on the LW, MW and Shortwave bands..  But for now, its a (not very fancy) receiver
for the SAQ transmitter.
<br><br>

You can download a deb package for linux (debian 9 or there about) here:
booma <a href="booma_{MAJORVERSION}.{MINORVERSION}-{BUILD}_amd64.deb">booma_{MAJORVERSION}.{MINORVERSION}-{BUILD}_amd64.deb</a> or you can build from the sources found at Github:
<a href="https://github.com/The3rdPlace/Booma.git">https://github.com/The3rdPlace/Booma.git</a>
<br><br>

Booma requires the Hardt toolkit (The Hamradio DSP Toolkit) found here <a href="http://hardttoolkit.org/">http://hardttoolkit.org/</a>
and PortAudio <a href="http://www.portaudio.com/">http://www.portaudio.com/</a>
