        <h3>This is <u>Booma</u> - a SDR VLF receiver </h3>
        Booma was born out of curiosity while listening to the <a href="https://alexander.n.se">SAQ / Grimeton transmitter</a>
        and wondering why so few SDR receivers and dongles could receive these low frequencies.
        <br>
        <br>
        Other options for listening to SAQ Grimeton is the <a href="<https://sites.google.com/site/sm6lkm/saqrx/">SAQrx</a> program by Johan, SM6LKM., a (newer) fork
        of SAQrx <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/swljo30tb/">SAQrx_V094</a>, or a websdr receiver <a href="http://websdr.ewi.utwente.nl:8901/">like this on in Twente</a>

        I have been fascinated with the lower part of the frequency spectrum, ever since I entered
        a room full of the sounds of the 80m band at night at the JOTA event.
        <br>
        As a ham radio operator, I do find it amazing that I can close a contact with a fellow (he, she or binary) 8.000km's away just by pumping about as much electricity
        as an old fashioned lightbulb into a piece of wire strong across my garding, but there's a certain magic when the waves becomes extra long.
        <br>
        The first contacts I made on 160m was fantastic, and when I found about the Grimeton transmitter in sweeden (by coincidence, passing the antennas on the highway en
        route to Oslo), transmitting on a whooping 17.2KHz - I was captured.
        <br>
        <br>
        Being able to generate 17.2KHz is one thing, that can be done with a violin bow, an organ pipe or the simplest electronic oscillator (whom amongst the ham fellowship
        has not put together an <i>astable multivibrator</i>?), but putting that frequency out into the skies - and  being able to receive it somewhere else.!
        Thats stills stands as a bit of a mystery for me.
        <br>
        <br>
        Not many receivers exists for such low frequencies, but the energies is (at least in europe) large enough so that we can capture these transmissions
        just by using the microphone input of a soundcard and a (not too short) piece of wire. So this was a challenge too good to let go. Also, I have long wanted
        to use my, somewhat prehistoric knownledge of digital signalprocessing from college, for a real project. So this spawned the Booma project.
        <br>
        <br>
        The digital signal processing is done by a lowlevel framework <u>Hardt</u> (The Hamradio DSP Toolkit), written as part of this project, but separated out
        since I want to be able to use it for other smaller projects as well (<a href="http://hardttoolkit.org/">here</a>).
        <br>
        <br>
        Currently, all Booma can do, is to receive on frequencies in the audio range (using a soundcard as the receiver frontend),
        and detecting CW and RTTY signals. However, I have big plans for extending the basic receiver for use with RTL based
        sdr dongles, at least for receiving LW, MW and shortwave bands..  But for now, its a (not very fancy) receiver
        for the SAQ transmitter.
        <br>
        <br>
        Also, only a console application exists for controlling the receiver, but once the inner parts of the receiver has stabilized, I will
        begin to put together a more userfriendly (modern) graphical user interface.
        <br>
        <br>
        You can run Booma entirely from a single pc, using the soundcard and some wire as an antenne - or you can scale it up a bit.
        <br>
        <br>
        I have a Raspberry Pi (zero) in the basement with a USB soundcard and connected to the microphone input, aprox. 50m of wire strong into a hedge.
        <br>
        The Raspberry Pi is run from a good linear stabilized power supply, and wired directly to an ethernet switch - and thats important since a wifi ethernet card do
        generate quite a big burst of noise when transmitting, which ruins VLF reception.
        <br>
        In my shack elsewhere in the house, I run Booma on my mac, receiving the antenna input from the Raspberry Pi. This way, I have moved
        the actual receiver as long away from in-house noise sources as possible (50Hz mains, the freezer, switched power adapters etc. etc.)

    <div id="requirements">
        Booma requires the Hardt toolkit (The Hamradio DSP Toolkit) found here <a href="http://hardttoolkit.org/">http://hardttoolkit.org/</a>
        and PortAudio <a href="http://www.portaudio.com/">http://www.portaudio.com/</a>. If you want to build Booma (and Hardt), you also need
        the CLang compiler and CMake, on the Mac CLang somehow is part of XCode so you may need to upgrade or install XCode if you dont already have it.
        <br>
        <br>
        Hardt and Booma builds on Linux (tested on Debian, but any distro should be fine), Mac and Raspberry Pi (with the Raspian OS, others  may work too).
        Small adjustments is needed to make them build on win32, but I am working on that, so either a Cygwin GCC or the (free) Visual Studio suite should
        work as well in the near future.

    <br>

    <div id="install">
        <span class="DEBVISIBLE">
        You can download a deb package for linux (debian 9 or there about) here:
            <a href="booma_{MAJORVERSION}.{MINORVERSION}-{BUILD}_amd64.deb">booma_{MAJORVERSION}.{MINORVERSION}-{BUILD}_amd64.deb</a> and install with
            <ul>
                <li class="command">sudo dpkg -i booma_{MAJORVERSION}.{MINORVERSION}-{BUILD}_amd64.deb</li>
            </ul>
        </span>
        Build from the sources from the public Github repo at
        <a href="https://github.com/The3rdPlace/Booma.git">https://github.com/The3rdPlace/Booma.git</a>
        <ul>
            <li class="command">cmake .</li>
            <li class="command">make</li>
            <li class="command">sudo make install</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div id="using">
        Once you have installed Booma, you have two (well three, but one is not very usefull at the  moment) applications.
        <ul><li>booma-console</li><li>booma-remote</li></ul>
        Both applications is essential the same receiver, but booma-remote does not have any command input once started,
        so if you operate a split setup, as I do, booma-remote is running on the Raspberry Pi, and booma-console is running
        on my macbook in the shack (further down the road, booma-guui will be the preferred application in the shack).
        <br><br>
        To get started, check which sounddevices is available on your system and note which one is the input where the antenna is connected, and which one is the output:
        <ul><li class="command">booma-console -c (or booma-remote -c)</li></ul>
        You can then start booma-console:
        <ul><li class="command">booma-console -i AUDIO (input device number) -o (output device number)</li></ul>
        If you wish to run a remote setup, then it looks like this:
        <ul>
            <li>(on the remote system) <span class="command">booma-remote -i AUDIO (input device number) -s (tcp port)</span></li>
            <li>(on the local system) <span class="command">booma-console -r (ip address of the server) (tcp port)</span></li>
        </ul>
        There are other options as well, just run <span class="command">booma-console -h</span> to get help.
        <br><br>
        <b>Important note:</b> On some systems, PortAudio may not be accessible to regular users, so <span class="command">booma-console -c</span> will
        return 'no devices found', and trying to start the receiver will result in an error.
        <br>
        In that case, you either need to set booma-console/booma-remote <span class="command">suid</span> or run with <span class="command">sudo</span>. The Raspian
        OS behaves like this, and other linux distros may have been configured this way too.
